# Mario's Murder Mystery

In this project, Michelle Noordeloos and Mark Ulrich set out to make a simple but engaging murder mystery game made entirely in plain C#. As this was a GameJam organised by the MediaCollege Amsterdam and this was a graded project, we were given a template made by our teacher as a basis to build upon for the next 3-4 weeks.

We have made several systems to turn this into the murder mystery game it now is, including but not limited to: A fully packaged dialogue system that allows creators to add characters, dialogue for those characters but also branching story points based on choises, this system also includes fully operational menus and modular code. More than that, we have made a simple inventory system as well as an interactive system that allows the player to talk with characters and pick up items.

## The Game
Mario has been murdered! Play as detective Shroomlock and solve the mystery behind the tragic death of the beloved Italian plumber. Search the world for clues and talk with iconic characters from the Mario universe to gather information about the murder. When you think you have all the information you need, talk with the judge, Hammer Bro, start the trial and figure out the mysterious murder of the beloved Mario!

The project is pure Windows/2D, no Unity was used in the making of this game. It can also be run on linux when the mono framework has been installed, converting to .net 5/6 or core is also possible but then you will lose linux support.
